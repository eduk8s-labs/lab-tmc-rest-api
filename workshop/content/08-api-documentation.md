Presuming the REST API client access checks out okay, the next thing we need to work out is what sort of requests we can make against the TMC REST API.

Documentation for the TMC REST API can be found at:

```dashboard:open-url
url: https://code.vmware.com/apis/1079/tanzu-mission-control
```

In the remainder of this workshop we will explore some of these REST APIs to perform some tasks against TMC.
